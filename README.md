python program to keep track of expanses. this program just writes collected data to a csv file.
I am using csv file because I found it that csv files can be read by many operating systems and are mainly used to keep track all sorts of 
records.

There are many things you can do with this piece of code. feel free to cotribute or use it as foundation for any project you want to build.
